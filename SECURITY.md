## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a potential security vulnerability within this project, please report it through one of the following methods:

1.  **Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Use the [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository) feature if it is enabled for this repository.
2.  **Email:** Contact the maintainer directly at klootwijkc@gmail.com.

### What to include in your report
To help us resolve the issue quickly, please include:
* A description of the vulnerability.
* The steps required to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept).
* Any potential impact the vulnerability might have.

### Our Response Process
* **Acknowledgment:** You can expect an initial acknowledgment of your report within **48–72 hours**.
* **Status Updates:** We will provide updates at least once a week while the issue is being investigated.
* **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and notify you once the patch is deployed. If declined, we will provide a clear explanation as to why.

## Third-Party Dependencies
This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Security issues related to the GitHub infrastructure itself should be reported directly to the [GitHub Security Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
