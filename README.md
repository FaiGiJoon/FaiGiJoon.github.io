# FaiGiJoon.github.io

Personal portfolio website built with a modern dark/glass design and Tailwind CSS. The current `index.html` contains a full one‑page layout including:

- **Hero** section with animated gradient text and call‑to‑action buttons
- **About** overview with availability badge
- **Skills** grid with animated progress bars (technical, cloud/tools, soft skills)
- **Experience** timeline of past roles
- **Blog** previews
- **Contact** form powered by Formspree
- **Footer** with social links and custom Lucide icons

### Technologies

- Tailwind CSS (via CDN) with a small custom configuration for colors, animations and fonts.
- Vanilla JavaScript for mobile navigation toggle, scroll‑reveal animations, and skill bar animations.
- Lucide icon library loaded from unpkg.
- CSP-friendly structure: minimal inline scripts/styles (all JS lives in the bottom of `index.html`), and assets are served locally.
